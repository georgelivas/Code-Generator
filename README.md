# What is CodeGen?
CodeGen is a code generator which can create codes of 16 characters long and the 
user haves the ability to export them in a text file (.txt). Codegen can create unlimited passwords in seconds. You can also visit the [website](http://georgelivas.github.io/Code-Generator/) for more information!

## Security
Each password contains: 

- 4 capital letters (A,B,C)
- 4 lowercase letters (a,b,c) 
- 4 numbers (1,2,3)
- 4 special characters (!,@,Â£)
**in random order.**

So the outcome is similar to this: 
> $0GyLs!#fjJ"7P49

The generated codes are unpredictable and the possibility of a code been generated twice is 0,013%.
