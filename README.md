CodeGen is a code generator which can create codes of 16 characters long and the 
user haves the ability to store them in a text file (.txt). Each password
contains: 
4 capital letters (A,B,C), 
4 lowercase letters (a,b,c), 
4 numbers (1,2,3) and 
4 special characters (!,@,Â£) in random order.
So the outcome is similar to this: $0GyLs!#fjJ"7P49 .
The generated codes are unpredictable and the possibility of a code been generated twice is 0,3333333 %.
